Purpose: 
Tabi is a tab splitting app, which will be used to assist in 
being able to split the bill when youre out with friends or getting a drink.
It allows users to be responsable for their part of the bill including an
equal split of taxes and tip. 

How it works:
1) Click top right to create a new tab to split
2) Enter requested info in pop up
3) Go to next page where you enter Items for your tab
4) Select the name of the person, tap all items they had.
5) Continue per person
6) Next page enter tax and tip
7) Calculate necessary costs
8) Add a share button to share to each friend via a message

Develope a timeline:
- Fix weird spacing in list second view below entering name and price
- Add Navigation link to final info tab
- Build a view for Final information for tab
- Work on people data models/objects to store each persons price and how much they owe
