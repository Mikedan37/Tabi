How it works:
1) Click top rigt to create a new tab to split
2) Enter requested info in pop up
3) Go to next page where you enter Items for your tab
4) Select the name of the person, tap all items they had.
5) Continue per person
6) Next page enter tax and tip
7) Calculate necessary costs
8) Add a share button to share to each friend

- Work on Persistance for each Tab and all of its values (Preferrably JSON file in on open and file out
on close/exit

- Work on view that 
- Build a view for Final calculations
